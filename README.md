***Exploring the Emotify dataset: genre and emotion prediction***

Final project for the DT2470 Music Informatics course at KTH.
Done by Carsten van de Kamp and Sergi Andreu.

# Intentions

Music is a powerful and common tool for mood regulation, but it is hard to predict the induced emotion for a musical piece. 
We explore this problem with the Emotify dataset, which contains 400 songs from four different genres, annotated on the Geneva Emotional Music scale.

This repository contains preprocessing on the Emotify dataset, as well as a set of notebooks trained on the preprocessed data for both genre and emotion prediction, using different approaches.

# Content

- ***/data/***  consists on information and samples of the emotify dataset.
- ***/emotion recognition/*** contains notebooks for predicting emotions from the preprocessed musical samples in the emotify dataset.
- ***/genre recognition/*** contains notebooks for predicting the genres from the preprocessed musical samples in the emotify dataset.
- ***/literature/*** relevant references for this work.
- ***/preprocessing/*** notebooks for extracting the labels from the annotations, as well as features from the audio samples. These are used for training the models.
- ***/presentation*** Overwiew of the project, used in the final presentation of the course.
